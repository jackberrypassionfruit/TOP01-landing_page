                <p> Our names are Kate Pashayan and Grace Pashayan, and in 2003 we both had the idea to open a sustainably run, non-profit seeking cupcakes company out of our grandmother's library. Since then we've revived the economy of Deer Lane, and are looking to expand!</p>
                <p> Please support us either by buying some of our delicious cupcakes, or by signing up for our newletter here.</p>

                    <p>First, we realized that we both reaaaaally like eating cupcakes, then we realized that making them was pretty fun too!</p>

                    <p>We were inspired by our love for the hypothetical dog that we always wanted but never got, and we channel that love into each and every cupcake that we make.</p>

                    <p>Money was never our main driving factor, but it certainly greases the gears, even better than Pam on a rusty baking sheet.</p>

                    <p>Our big goal is to make enough money so that we can buy every comapny ever, and put a stop to their bad unsustainable habits so we can end/reverse climate change. Through cupcakes!</p>

            <p><em>As Kate's older, I have a lot of reason to be biased in favor of my sister's cupcakes. In fact, it'd really be silly of me to say anything but a glowing endorsement of her and her hard work, because there's a lot of good karma coming back to me in return. Just last week I told her that her hair looks nice, and she gave me agreat recipe for Shakshuka and gave me advice ona  date. She's gave me some cupakes to take on the date, and her and her friends liked them a lot. I'm seeing her next Saturday for a hiking trip or a day at the museum or something.<br> <br>What did you ask me about again? Anyway, the cupcakes are  pretty great!</em></p>
